building cyanogen mod from sourcecode :

1. set up linux ubuntu 11.04 (recommened) on VMware or somewhere else ..
Iï¿½m using Kubuntu 11.10 and its working fine ...

2. download my Sin_CM7_rom_script.sh script and execute it 

sh Sin_CM7_rom_script.sh

This script download all needed files to compile a full cyanogen mod 7 rom with blendmiui kernel..

This process takes from 1 to 6 hours TIME !!!! It will download a few GB Sourcecode files ...


The Rom Folder structure on your ubuntu will look like :

this are only the folders you must know for now



/home/username/android/system                       => cm7 mainsystem

/home/username/android/system/kernel                => here is your BlendMIUI Kernel SourceCode from JasonStein

/home/username/android/system/device/anzu           => your xperia arc device build files
/home/username/android/system/device/mogami-common  => your mogami platform with WiFi drivers !!!
/home/username/android/system/device/msm7x30-common => your msm7x30 build files with recovery data
/home/username/android/system/vendor/semc/anzu      => your SEMC Anzu Vendor proprietary files (sony factory files)


when the repo has successfully synced the files to your harddisk , you should make a restart of ubuntu ..




3. Now we can start compile the kernel and wifi modules !


#download ARM Cross Compiler from internet and put into {username}/opt dic.

## You can also use arm-linaro cross compiler from here : https://github.com/DooMLoRD/android_prebuilt_toolchains


git clone git://github.com/DooMLoRD/android_prebuilt_toolchains.git toolchains




wget http://www.codesourcery.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/package7813/public/arm-none-eabi/arm-2010.09-51-arm-none-eabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

bunzip2 arm-2010.09-51-arm-none-eabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

tar -xf arm-2010.09-51-arm-none-eabi-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar

#allow to paste all commands at once.

sudo mv arm-2010.09 /opt/ && \

sudo ln -s /opt/arm-2010.09/bin/* /usr/bin/;                                    #link new binaries in path


#export your prebuild toolchains to path. change the username first !!!

export PATH=/<toolchain_folder>/bin:$PATH
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-eabi-

#mine looks like that

export PATH=/home/saosin/android/system/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin:$PATH
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-


#then go to android/system/kernel dic. and type following : (with your path !!! ) i take arm-eabi-linaro-4.6.2 for cm9 !!

ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/saosin/opt/arm-eabi-linaro-4.6.2/bin/arm-eabi- make miui_anzu_defconfig

ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/saosin/android/system/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.0/bin/arm-eabi- make 


# You will get zImage under kernel/arch/arm/boot dic.



###now build wifi modules  not needed for now  we all use BlendMIUI kernel 




#BUILD KERNEL boot.img / BUILD CM7 rom with 3G


#First,download rommanager

Code:

cd ~/android/system/vendor/cyanogen/

./get-rommanager

./extract-google-files -v MDPI


Then goto android/system/device/semc/anzu dic


run setup-makefiles.sh(you'd better set permission first:chmod 777 setup-makefiles.sh)



#Replace kernel file in

android/system/device/semc/anzu dic by your zImage(rename it to kernel)


#Begin to compile whole rom.

Code:

cd ~/android/system/

. build/envsetup.sh

lunch

#then choose number of anzu to begin.

type number and hit enter 

#Now compile:

make



#Or for a flashable zip:

make otapackage




#this compile process takes some time to finish !!!


#when everything worked fine , then you can find your flashable zip file and system folder from your own compiled cm7 rom under :

/home/username/android/system/out/target/product/anzu   

in the out folder must be :

boot.img  => you should not use this for now !! take blendmiui kernel boot.img
flashable.zip => cm7 rom should be normal working with blendmiui kernel
system folder => here are rom files you can use to update the BMSPS !!
